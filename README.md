# loyalbuddy
This program cleans your chrome history and private files(optional) if you don't login before the time you set.
Make sure that you downloaded both main.py and my_loyal_buddy.py and store them in the same directory.
Do not run my_loyal_buddy.py externally. Use main.py and after first use, you can delete my_loyal_buddy.py
