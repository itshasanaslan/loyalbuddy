# loyalbuddy
This program cleans your Chrome history and, optionally, private files if you don't log in before the time you set.
Make sure to download both main.py and my_loyal_buddy.py and store them in the same directory.
Do not run my_loyal_buddy.py directly. Use main.py, and after the first use, you can delete my_loyal_buddy.py.
